Computational Designer Â· Creative Technologist Â· Visual Strategist Â· Researcher

---

A multidisciplinary artist and systems thinker working at the edge of design, technology, and story. I use research as the foundation for creative developmentâ€”translating insight into structure, systems, and symbolic language.

My practice blends:
- Visual identity and story frameworks  
- Web-based creative tools and modular thinking  
- Computational and embodied design  
- Research as ritual and method

Currently learning and applying:
- Vibe-coding & generative workflows  
- Wolfram Mathematica, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript  
- Experimental UI scaffolds, system prototyping, and logic-based creativity
